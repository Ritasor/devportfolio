<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)" p>What is the difference between physical computing and IoT?</p>

point The physical computing concept involves interacting with hardware components and IoT concepts to make
those components accessible over a network.
Physical computing is an underpinning technology to drive IoT applications.
IoT is better than physical computing devices.
A physical computing device is an independent device that cannot connect to other devices whereas IoT devices can.
Questions:
<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)" p><b>2 What is the correct statement for the physical computing concept?</b></p>

A physical hardware component that can sense and respond to the world around it.
An intangible software installed on the embedded microcontroller-based system that can sense, reason and
transmit/receive data to another device.
None of the above
A virtual interactive system that can simulate the world around it and/or control the outputs, such as lights,
displays and motors.

    From the knowledge acquired during lecture period . I got to know the important IOT infrastructure and its
    importance and how its setup has help me understand the different components that are involved in establishing an
    IOT infrastructure and the challenges that come that are .I gained a better understanding of the various elements
    and difficulties involved in building an IOT infrastructure thanks to discussions on its setup. It also made it
    easier for me to understand the technical, planning, and security abilities needed to build up and maintain the
    infrastructure. Additionally, I was aware of how crucial data governance, scalability, and maintenance were to the
    system's efficient operation.
    Furthermore, I was aware of how crucial IoT was to many sectors, including agriculture and greenhouses. Farmers can
    have improved visibility, control, and optimization of greenhouse conditions with the use of IoT, which may result
    in a higher yield, better-quality produce, and lower expenses.
    I also came to see how important it was to take into account environmental factors that could affect how well IOT
    devices function, such as temperature, humidity, dust, vermin, and other harsh weather conditions. The devices must
    be designed, protected, and maintained properly to ensure proper operation and accurate data collection and
    transmission.
