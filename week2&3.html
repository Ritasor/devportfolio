come
in many forms,

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Remote working risks</b> </p>Staff may be using out-of-date routers in their
homes, working on their own
vulnerable devices,or connecting to unsecured wi-fi networks in cafés. According to Jesse Mrasek, Senior Cloud
Solutions

and
it may
not even be possible if the routers are old.

    <p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Common Cybersecurity Threats to Small Businesses</p>
</h2>
</b>
<b>Viruses</b>Basically, viruses were designed to provide access to your systems. They infect, then spread from
computer
to computer, and even other devices.
While some of them are easy to eliminate and prevent, others can latch on tight and become almost impossible to
shake.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Malware</b></p>
This attack was designed with the sole purpose of causing harm to your systems. It’s otherwise known as malicious
software.
It can come in the form of a virus or ransomware.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Ransomware</b></p>
This type of attack is manipulative, as it infects and restricts access to your own computer until a ransom is paid.
Ransomware is mostly delivered in the form of an email. It exploits a weakness in software.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"></p><b>Phishing</b></p>
This technique uses email or messages to spread malicious software. You may receive an email stating it’s from a
well-known company or even a friend. Inside the email, there will be a link. If you open the link, malware will be
released into your system infecting your computer.
This form can be dangerous as so many people assume they’re receiving a legitimate email.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)">
<h2><b>How to Protect Your Small Business</p></b></h2>



<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)">><b>Protect information and update</b></p> Make sure your computers are
“clean”. What this means is utilizing
all
updates and
anti-viral software.
If you must invest in anti-viral software that works, then the investment is worth it. Make sure you have the
latest
software and run a scan after every update.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Teach employees about security </b></p>Implement basic policies across the
board for all employees. Insist on
using
strong passwords and enforce penalties for not taking cybersecurity policies seriously.
Also, educate your employees on how to keep vital information and customer data safe as well.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Mobile device protection</b></p>
Since most employee’s mobile devices are connected to the company network, they usually hold confidential
information.
Employees should password-protect their devices, use encryption, and keep security apps updated. This safeguards
against
that line of infiltration.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"></p><b>Use a firewall</b></p>
Just like any computer, a firewall is useful when hard stopping an attack. It’s the initial response when a
cybercriminal is trying to breach systems or worm their way into private networks and data. All computers,
whether
in
the company’s office or in a work at home environment should be fitted with a quality firewall.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Backup information</b></p> No matter what it is, back up all information.
Some cyberattacks can be so brutal
that
they
can crash your entire system. If you don’t have a backup of any information, it will take forever to get back to
the
level you were before the attack.
Keep in mind, you have critical data when you have a small business, and losing this data can cause problems for
you
and
your customer. Back up everything and backup often.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Limit employee access</b></p>
Employees should only have access to certain data systems that they need for their job. Allowing all employees
to
access
all systems and data can possibly cause leaking of information, not necessarily on purpose, but even my mistake,
this
can lead to criminal activity.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Payment safety</b></p>
Make sure that you and your company bank are on the same page. Most banks will alert you to things that appear
to be
fraudulent activity, even if it’s not.
They are alert and always want to make sure that you are aware of any transactions going through their system.
Make
sure
you use a bank that works in this manner.
It may seem frustrating to wait for a pending payment, but it’s a good indication that your bank is trying to
keep
your
company safe. Also, on your end, do not use the same computer to process payments as you do to search the
internet.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Wi-Fi security</b></p>
Always make sure your Wi-Fi network is secure, hidden, and encrypted. Make sure your SSDI or the network name is
not
broadcasted.
Protect this with a password key so only a selected few can access the router and settings.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)" p><b>Create a mobile device action plan</b></p>
Mobile devices can create significant security and management challenges, especially if they hold confidential
information or can access the corporate network.
Require users to password-protect their devices, encrypt their data, and install security apps to prevent
criminals
from
stealing information while the phone is on public networks.
Be sure to set reporting procedures for lost or stolen equipment.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Passwords and authentication</b></p>
Require employees to use unique passwords and change passwords every three months. Consider implementing
multi-factor
authentication that requires additional information beyond a password to gain entry.
Check with your vendors that handle sensitive data, especially financial institutions, to see if they offer
multi-factor
authentication for your account.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy
        crisis' experienced worldwide in
        2022?</b></p>
Energy markets began to tighten in 2021 because of a variety of factors, including the extraordinarily rapid
economic
rebound following the pandemic. But the situation escalated dramatically into a full-blown global energy crisis
following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The global energy crisis has led to the increase in gas
and
electricity, causing pricing to go up. Enterprises are dependent on energy and therefore the lack of it can lead
to
their downfall. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has made the crisis worse, prohibiting some countries from
receiving
gas
supplies (Melville, 2022). Ultimately, the rise in energy costs impacts business’s. In summary, the cost of
production
has increased leading to an increase in revenue
