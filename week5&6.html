granted access.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Earn or give, but never assume trust:</b></p> The first is to earn or give, but
never assume trust. This is to
say that security
designs that place authorisation, access control, enforcement of security policy, or embedded sensitive data in the hand
of users will often lead to compromises.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Use an authentication mechanism that cannot be compromised:</b></p> The second is
to use an authentication
mechanism that cannot
be compromised. This means preventing the ability to bypass an authentication mechanism which can result in an
unauthorised entity having access to a system or service.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Ensure all data are explicitly validated.</b> </p>This can be achieved using
centralised mechanisms to ensure that all
data
entering a system from an external or a major component within the system are appropriately validated
Identify sensitive data and mechanism to handle. It is important to identify sensitive data and the mechanism to
handle
it. This is because the definition of sensitive can depend on the context, jurisdiction, regulatory, as well as
company
policies.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Use cryptography correctly.</b></p> cryptography remains one of the most important
technologies for building secure
systems.
However, issues such as the misuse of libraries and algorithms mean it may not be safe to assume libraries are
sufficiently safe.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Users must always be considered.</b></p> It is said that security is not a feature
that can simply be added to a
software
system, but rather a property emerging from how the system was built and is operated (and the operators are the
users).
<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Understand the effects of changes to integrating external components and attack
        surface.</b></p> We are now in the era of software development where the reuse of software components is being
encouraged.
It is, therefore,important to
understand the effects of changes to integrating external components in software development. Reusing
software
components mean that the software will inherit the security weaknesses of that component.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Flexibility required when changing objects and actors.</b></p> Another tip is that
flexibility is required when
changing objects
and actors. That is to say, a system that works well at this point in time might find itself exposed to
new threats as a
result of changes in settings or the environment in which it was originally deployed. Therefore,
flexibility is required
in the design to allow for factors such as security updates.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Authorise after you authenticate. </b></p>The third is to always ensure a two-step
process: authorisation after
authentication.
Authorisation may depend on the privileges associated with an authentication, as well as the context of
the request. For
example, the time of the request and the location of the requesting user may both need to be
considered.</p>
