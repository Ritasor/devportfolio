<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Attacks on Enterprise Networks</p></b>A network attack is an effort to enter a
company's network without
authorization with the intent of stealing information
or carrying out other destructive behavior. I also came to the realization that companies need to be ready to
adapt their operating procedures in order to keep up
with new technology and protect themselves from internet threats.

Attack is a series of continuous steps which are launched to gain unauthorised entry into different assets of the
enterprise network.
The attacks on the enterprise networks are launched for attacker's own benefit. Attacks are usually classified into two
categories (Stallings 2011):
1. Active Attacks: In these attacks, the attacker actively modifies or tempers the transmitted messages from source
towards destination.

2. Passive Attacks: These are of eavesdropping nature where an attacker is passively monitoring the transmission

</b></p>

Attack is not a rapid procedure, but it is the result of continuous planning by the attacker. It is highly possible that
the attacker is monitoring the enterprise network for a long period of time and launches an attack when he/she finds any
suitable way to enter the network premises. Following the discovery of a way into the system, major steps are carried
out by the attacker to launch an attack.
1. The attacker continuously monitors the enterprise network and its assets, such as information, internal communication
network.
2. Attacker collects all the related information of the enterprise network. The major aim of this step is to identify
the vulnerability in the network.
3. Attacker plans and analyses the strategy to launch an attack on the enterprise network by exploiting the identified
vulnerability in the network or system. This step involves planning the attack on the networkâ€™s asset.
4. Once, the attacker has identified the method to gain entry into the network, the next step involves the execution of
attack by the attacker through the identified weakness in the network.
5. the last step is the clearance of attack steps by the attacker, so that he/she can't be traced.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)">Factors for carrying an attack on enterprise network
    </b></p>Attacks are launched by attackers for their own benefit. It is also possible that the attacker may launch an
attack on the enterprise network and share the critical information with a third party who may be interested in the data
of the desired enterprise. There are lots of factors to pursuing an attack on the enterprise network, but we will
explain the four major factors which can be used to initiate an attack on the enterprise network.
<p> 1. Attacker Motivation: Motivation is a major factor to carrying and pursuing an attack on an enterprise network.
    Mostly, the motivation is categorised into three levels, i.e., high, medium and low motivation (Sanzgiri, and
    Upadhyaya, 2011). The enterprise networks have high risks if the attacker is highly motivated and vice versa. </p>

<p>2. Budget for an attack: The impact of an attack highly depends on the budget of the attacker. To be able to launch
    an
    attack on the network the attacker needs resources (Sanzgiri, 2013). If the attacker has many resources and a high
    budget, the attacker can launch quite a severe attack. The attacker with the limited budget would only be targeting
    a
    specific asset for its attack. The impact can depend on the exploitation of the vulnerability. The impact in such
    cases
    can be minimised as only a particular asset is being targeted by the attacker. However, on the other hand, the
    attacker
    with a high budget can target multiple assets. The scope of an attack in such cases can be at maximum severity,
    therefore monitoring and identifying the impact of the attack can be very important and complex.</p>

<p>3. Time to launch an attack: This factor represents the total time taken by an attacker to launch an attack. This
    includes time taken for monitoring, information gathering,
    attack launching and trace clearance by an attacker (ETSI 2011).
    Time is a crucial factor as the attacker may be able to launch an attack on the asset in short space of time, which
    may have severe consequences on the enterprise. </p>
<p>. Increased personal reputation: This factor deals with the attacker's motivation of attaining fame as a hacker or
    experienced attacker. To gain notoriety,
    the hacker will launch a complex attack with intelligence so that it will take the network administrator a long time
    to identify the attack and its methodology.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)">Possible Attacks on Enterprise Networks </p>
An enterprise can face a wide range of attacks which depends on different factors as discussed above. In this section,
we will discuss the major attacks which most of the enterprise networks deal with most of the time.

<p style="color:rgb(207, 59, 155)"><b>Man-in-the-middle </b>
    attack Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are well known attacks which are launched on different assets of enterprise.
    The term Man-in-the-middle is derived from a volleyball scenario, where a player from Team 1 snatches the ball when
    it is tossed and shared between two players of Team 2 (Nayak and Samaddar 2010). The same concept is derived in
    enterprise where an illegal node or attacker launches an attack in between when two departments of an enterprise
    share information between themselves or with the customer. The attacker launches MITM in two modes (Kemmerer 2018):
    <b>1. Passive mode:</b> In this mode, the attacker listens to the communication and captures the information without
    modifying the content.
</p>
<p><b>2. Active mode:</b> In this mode, the attacker actively listens to the communication channel, captures the
    information and changes the content deliberately. Figure 4.3 illustrates the man-in-the-middle attacks on enterprise
    networks. It shows that the two departments (finance and HR) of an enterprise communicate via two communication
    channels. In an ideal situation where no attacker is present, the two departments communicate with each other via a
    normal communication channel. However, in presence of an MITM attacker, the two departments communicate via the
    attacker, which can be perform in two modes (active and passive) as mentioned above. Figure 4.3: Illustration of
    man-in-the-middle attack on enterprise network</p>
