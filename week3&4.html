    </p> The SolarWinds hack was a software supply chain attack perpetrated against American
    software
    company SolarWinds, which develops and maintains network monitoring tools used by major businesses and
    government agencies.
    Hackers purportedly compromised SolarWinds' Orion software build via an already-compromised Microsoft Office
    365 account.
    Backdoors were later distributed into user networks once tainted Orion updates were installed.
</div>
<div>According to a statement by SolarWinds. the attackers ran a master class in novel hacking techniques created a
    system that used domain names to
    select targets and mimicked the Orion software communication protocols so they could hide in plain sight, which were
    installed by customers in the spring of 2020</div>
<div>But the hackers had already gained access to SolarWinds’ software development system in October of 2019,
    according to Security Week, likely through SolarWinds’ already-compromised Microsoft Office 365 account.</div>
<p>hackers then spent months implementing botnet command-and-control protocols, and in March of 2020, began inserting
    trojans into the updates that customers would ultimately install.
    Once installed, this malware, dubbed SUNBURST, distributed backdoors that communicate to third-party servers into
    customers’ systems, giving the hackers remote access to emails, confidential documents, and other sensitive
    information.
    But here’s the worst part: neither SolarWinds nor its customers knew that any sort of breach had occurred until
    December of 2020, more than a year after the hackers initially gained access to SolarWinds’ build environment and
    nine months after the first poisoned update was released in March.
    the malicious code was inserted into an Orion plug-in called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll, a typical
    library component found in Orion software updates.
</p>
<p>This compromised plug-in was digitally signed by a seemingly valid but actually compromised SolarWinds certificate.
    In other words, it was able to masquerade, totally undetected, as a legitimate, trusted, SolarWinds-verified library
    file that, once executed, whether during an automatic update or manually by the user, would begin to wreak its
    havoc, the user unwitting all the while.
    the backdoor was designed to remain dormant for 14 days before retrieving and executing commands that include the
    ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services,
    according to cybersecurity company FireEye, which was also affected by the attack.
