<p>Lockheed Martin's cyber death chain is a popular framework for analyzing the phases of a cyber attack.
    Reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and operations on
    objectives are the seven stages of an attack that are described. Organizations may create better attack defenses
    and incident response strategies by understanding the various attack stages and the tactics attackers employ at
    each level. The cyber death chain, in my opinion, is a practical tool for spotting and countering online
    threats, but it shouldn't be viewed as a singular viewpoint given that attackers may employ several strategies
    to accomplish the same objective.
    The sooner an attack can be discovered and stopped, the less likely it is to cause damage.</p>
<p>Â have used my knowledge of the cyber death chain in a professional setting, and I recognize the value of the
    concept's applicability to various circumstances.</p>
