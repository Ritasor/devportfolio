    <p> Traceroute is one of the best OS-native network analytics tools. It is not only capable of testing
        connectivity.
        but it also finds all hops in between source and destination, including names, and delay times.</p>

    <p>i used tracert for my question 1 instead of traceroute due to some challeges
        finding question 2 was a little hard,i experienced some challenges what my dig then i had to surf the
        internet and found
        whois i installed it on my laptop which made it easer for me to scan

        From this course I now know most ping command how to use them and what is for I need not have much issue with my
        scanning activity.</p>
